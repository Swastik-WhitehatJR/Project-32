# Project-32
This contains the files that were edited and coded in the Project 32 in WhitehatJR Pro Course. It fetches data from an existing api and shows the current location time with a background day and night static animation. It is coded in javascript using "matter.js" and "p5.js". To change the logic, edit the code in the file 'sketch.js' file.
